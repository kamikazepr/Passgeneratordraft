##note this is a work in progress the hackathon is expected to be completed by 2-25-22
#currently pending is reading the variables (list) from file and picking a random value from such list.
# from there we need to validate and test the proper import of the lists into the else statement.
#note else statesments were testing and working among the selection of y/n

import random


#file input to variables, each file will contain several items which will be picked at random.
#file import format is File_object = open(r"File_Name","Access_Mode") example File_object = open(r"pronoun.txt","r") 
## note use g.seek(0) to go to the start of the file
#pronoun = pronoun.txt
#noun = noun.txt
#verb = verb.txt
#object = object.txt
#adjective = adjective.txt
